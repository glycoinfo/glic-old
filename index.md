<h2>Welcome to Glycoinformatics Consortium page!</h2>
 Variety of batabases in glycoinformatics field has been developed in different countries as a result of glycoscience research projects. However, usage of these developed databases has became difficult because of closure of databases corresponding to ending of projects. The closure of databases is becoming obstacles in glycoscience research. The Glycoinformatics Consortium is found to solve the obstacles and glycoinformaticians to develop batabases and tools with a coalition.<br>   
The purpose of Glycomeinoformatics Consortium(GLIC) is to provide and maintain a centralized source software repository for the glycosciences. In addition, it is aimed to provide communication point for glycoscientists and glycoinformaticians.
