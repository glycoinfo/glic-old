### GRITS Toolbox
  GRITS Toolbox is a glycomics MS data processing software. The software allows not just to load, visualize and browser glycomics MS data but also to annotate the data with glycan structures and their fragments. Automatic annotated data can be manually evaluated, changed and exported to Excel. In addition side by side comparison of the different experiment for the study of glycosylation changes and glycosylation expression changes can be performed as well. In addition the software also captures and manages meta data such as sample description and description of the performed experiment.

### GODESS
  NMR spectrum simulation service for carbohydrate-containing molecules (including polymers and glycoconjugates). The output includes signal assignment tables, 1D and multiple 2D spectra. For every simulated chemical shift the predictor reports the expected error, trustworthiness metrics and databases references to data used in the simulation. The software uses empirical approach with own dedicated databases, statistical approach based on CSDB content, and hybrid approach. Supported nuclei are 13C and 1H. Solvent and temperature are taken into account. On the level of structures it supports most structural features of saccharides (several hundred residues, alditols, furanoses, amino acids, fatty acids, sphingoids; glycosidic, amide, or diester linkages). Average accuracy obtained on a large pool of structures was 0.86 ppm for &sup1;&sup3;C and 0.07ppm for &sup1;H.

### ISOGlyP (Isoform Specific O-Glycosylation Prediction)
  ISOGlyP  analizes and roughly predicts isoform specific sites of mucin O-glycosylation for an entered protein sequence .  Future goals are to add the long range enhancing effects of remote O-glycosylation and the action of multiple transferases.  This work is being performed by a collaboration of Thomas Gerken at Case Western Reserve Univ. (School of Medicine) and  Ming-Ying Leung at the Univ. Texas at El Paso (Professor of Mathematical Sci. and Director Bioinformatics Program).  The Gerken  lab is generating the actual data utilizing a series of unique random (glyco)peptides (refs below) and the Leung lab has developed the web site.  We presently have the peptide sequence motif/propensity data for 10 of the 20 isoforms on the site and have generated the remote glycopeptide data on ~11 isoforms (not yet on the site).  We also have plans for developing similar approaches to predict the Core 1, Core 3 and sialylation substitution of the peptide GalNAc by similar methods.

### GlyPy
GlyPy is a modular and extensible library of glycan manipulation tools built in python with minimal dependencies.   This library is available for researchers as a resource to solve glyco-bioinformatics problems.  All that is required is a minimal knowledge of the general purpose, high level, python programming language. Designed for both batch processing and interactive use.
The library includes the following functions:

  * Read and write condensed GlycoCT, GlycoMinds Linear Code, IUPAC Linear Code, and read GlycoCT XML glycan structures
  
  * Calculate structure masses from monoisotopic or average composition, under theoretical neutral charge or under any charge state.
  
  * Build and modify glycan structures dynamically, with reverse-ability maintained wherever possible, adding or removing modifications, substituents, monosaccharides or other glycans to the graph structure.
  
  * Interact with glycan structures using natural pythonic expressions, providing a rich iterative interface for transforming graphs.
  
  * Generate fragments of glycan structures by cleaving one or more glycosidic bonds. Can generate A, B, C, X, Y and Z ions, as well as internal fragments
  
  * Derivatize glycan structures with arbitrary substituents.
  
  * CFG-style plots with colored shapes or IUPAC text for nodes.
  
  * GlycomeDB API and partial support for the recently exposed glySpace REST API
  
  * Self-documenting with Sphinx
  
  * Near 100% test coverage on the core library
  
  * Build portable databases of structures, indexed for fast search and retrieval.
  
  * Define new types of substituents and modifications as needed.
