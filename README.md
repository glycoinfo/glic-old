# GLIC
The purpose of the Glycoinformatics Consortium (GLIC) is to provide a centralized source software repository for 
glycoscientists. In addition, it is aimed to provide a communication point for glycoscientists and 
glycoinformaticians.  

This home page provides a list of software and databases for glycoscience research.  There is also a Wish List to which 
scientists can contribute requests for software, tools or databases.
