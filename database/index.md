## Database Resources

<br>

### GlycomeDB  
  Meta database that integrates the structures from several glycomics databases (CFG, KEGG, GLYCOSCIENCES.de, GlycoBase, JCGGDB, BCSDB, PDB, GlycO and Carbbank) into one consistent sequence representation and creating a unique index of all structures present in the integrated database. Species annotations from the other databases are retrieved as well and integrated using the NCBI Taxonomy. Each structure in GlycomeDB is linked back to the original database allowing finding and browsing all occurrences of a structure in multiple databases.

### UniCarbKB  
  The UniCarb KnowledgeBase (UniCarbKB) offers public access to a growing, curated database of information on the glycan structures of glycoproteins. UniCarbKB is an international effort that aims to further our understanding of structures, pathways and networks involved in glycosylation and glyco-mediated processes by integrating structural, experimental and functional glycoscience information. This initiative builds upon the success of the glycan structure database GlycoSuiteDB, together with the informatic standards introduced by EUROCarbDB, to provide a high-quality and updated resource to support glycomics and glycoproteomics research. UniCarbKB provides comprehensive information concerning glycan structures, and published glycoprotein information including global and site-specific attachment information.

### Carbohydrate Structure Database (CSDB)  
  The Carbohydrate Structure Databases (CSDBs) store structural, bibliographic, taxonomic, NMR spectroscopic, and other data on natural carbohydrates and their derivatives published in the scientific literature. The CSDB project was launched in 2005 for bacterial saccharides (as BCSDB). Currently, it includes two parts, the Bacterial CSDB and the Plant&Fungal CSDB. In March 2015, these databases were merged to the single Carbohydrate Structure Database (CSDB). The combined CSDB includes information on bacterial and archaeal glycans and derivatives (the coverage is close to complete), as well as on plant and fungal glycans and glycoconjugates (almost all structures published up to 1998). CSDB is regularly updated via manual expert annotation of original publications. Both newly annotated data and data imported from other databases are manually curated. The CSDB data are exportable in a number of modern formats, such as GlycoRDF. CSDB provides additional services for simulation of 1H, 13C and 2D NMR spectra of saccharides, NMR-based structure prediction, glycan-based taxon clustering, and other.

### SugarBindDB  
The SugarBind Database (SugarBindDB) covers knowledge of glycan binding of human pathogen lectins and adhesins. It is a curated database; each glycan-binding event is associated with at least one published reference. The core data of SugarBindDB is a triple constituted of a pathogenic agent, a lectin/adhesin and a glycan ligand. SugarBindDB content is displayed in views. All views are interconnected.
